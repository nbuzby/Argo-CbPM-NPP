# Argo-CbPM-NPP
Float-implementation of CbPM NPP model

## About 
information of implementation, and maybe stuff about directory setups?

## FUNCTIONS
### Main functions (to be called from script or command window):
list of stuff

### Auxilary functions (primarily called by main functions in background):
list of needs (e.g. BGC argo toolbox)

## REQUIREMENTS (mostly taken from One Argo README)
At least MATLAB R2019b (or any newer release) is needed to use these functions without modifications.
An Internet connection is needed to get the latest versions of Argo index and Sprof files
Memory requirements depend on the number of floats that are simultaneously loaded into memory. ???
